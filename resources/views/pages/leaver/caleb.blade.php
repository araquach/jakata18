        <h1>Caleb no longer working at the salon</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Earlier this week Caleb decided he wanted to leave the JAKATA team to go self employed.</strong></p>
        <p>We wish him luck in his new venture.</p>
        <p>As you have been a client of Caleb's we can only apologise for his quick departure. We would really love you to stay a client of JAKATA. 
        We have some exciting times ahead with our relocation to brand new premises, and we want you to experience it!
        Please take advantage of this special offer:</p>
        
        <p class="big"><strong>30% off</p>
        <p class="medium">your next 2 visits</strong></p>
        <p>with any of our stylists</p>
        <p class="small">Not with any other offer</p>
        
        <p><strong>We can highly reccomend Vikki who is the same level as Caleb. Layla also comes highly recommended, though the offer applies to any of our stylists.</strong></p>
        <p>We are also making this offer valid at our sister salon <strong>Paul Kemp Hairdressing</strong> who will also give you an amazing experience</p>
